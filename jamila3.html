			Meeting you in 2022? Was insane. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			At the time you told me you were 17 when you were really 16..
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			You lit something up for me tho and at that time i didnt know what it was.. i was confused but i loved every minute and second of it everyday.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Im going to skip all the sob stories that hurted us in the past to fast foward now. It's bad to just keep being stuckup in something hurtful and im sure you would agree too but i will warn you last page is a heavy hitter so please please be prepared and please know that im sorry for maybe making you cry. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Meeting you at that time was crazy! I met a girl named Jamila2091 which was stupid enough to put her first name in roblox for everyone to see.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			But she sounded cute and acted cute.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Little did i FUCKING know is that she was an insane hornball LMAO.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<br>
			<br>
			Would i complain tho? I wanted to fuck her alot so many times all the time..
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			But instead of just emotions i knew someday i would end up with her again..
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Let's just say i wish she still acted that horny w me today in 2025.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			SKIPPING TO 2024-2025.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Umm.. Yeah. Alot has happened aaaloot. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			One thing i always want jamila to know though is that i dont want her dead, i dont want her to beat herself up. i dont want her to do any single harm, mental or physical to herself.
			<br>
			<br>
			It angers me, It pains me, I really REALLY love her.
			<br>
			<br>
			No matter fucking what except stupid decisions she decides for herself. She should and DOES know that it causes harm to others without any contact. 
			<br>
			<br>
			But in the end i know shes going to be ok. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Because YOU yes YOU promised to marry me. The jamila that told me her goals was such a life taking experience to see because wow i love that you have goals. Go after it!!!!! 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br> 
			I know you're strong. Somewhere and out there YOU will make it to your dreams. Even having dreams is such an insane thing because not many normal people have them!
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Oh and another thing you are normal... YOU are normal... Shut up about the self doubt the self loss the sadness thinking your not going to make it... YOU WILL.
			<br>
			I love you so fucking MUCH i wrote notes
			<br>
			I wrote paragraphs
			<br>
			I became your therapist
			<br>
			I send snaps of myself to make you happy
			<br>
			You changed without even noticing and i notice it myself.
			<br>
			I wrote so many things i show infinite fucking love that it doesnt tire me at all..
			<br>
			I CODED THIS FUCKING WEBSITE!!! AND IM JUST LEARNING THIS TODAY SO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET MORE FUCKING LOVE GET YOUR LOVE ACCEPT IT TRULY ACCEPT THIS FUCKING LOVE.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Yes, we all know your going to say that i dont give enough love.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			That's ok like it really is because for me im a tough guy!!! grrrr we should be strong and not weak and anything
			<br>
			<br>
			just showing love to the future and already girlfriend and wife duh
			<br>
			<br>
			But seriously like other guys me including 1% of love from someone they really love and from someone that wanted THEM is enough.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			im just the weird one wanting attention too XP 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Oh my its the end of the page already this has 200+ lines of code and it makes me want to KILL MYSELF of how many BREAKS there are in this code... the website looks normal duh yea but holy shit this code page is insane... anyways..
			<br>
