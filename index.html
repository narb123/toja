        How strange is it to see this website? 
        <br>
         <br>
         <br><br>
			<br>
        Is it new? 
        <br>
         <br>
         <br><br>
			<br>
        I dont think anyone has ever done this for you im guessing right?
        <br>
         <br>
         <br>
        ..Anyways. 
        <br>
         <br>
         <br>
        My overthinking, overreactions we both agree that its... something right? It was given. And you know how.
        <br>
         <br>
         <br>
        All of them happens because i still love you and i want to make sure im the only one 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
		<br>
         <br>
         <br>
        its odd! 
        <br>
         <br>
         <br>
        i still want to show love!!
        <br>
         <br>
         <br>
        i still am writing so many times to show how much i love you. 
        <br>
         <br>
        You still probably think that im playing or not showing love... and i say.. UGH SHUT UP!!!!! IM SHOWING ALL THE DAMN LOVE I CAN I EVEN CREATED THIS DAMN THING WOMEN.
         <br>
         <br>
		<br>
         <br>
		<br>
         <br>
        ....joking kidding never shut up never ever doubt anything 
         <br>
        <br>
        just know i so damn much love you
         <br>
         <br>
        Theres a couple of more things i have to say before we get to the main point of everything and why i created this.... which is i love you i dont know how many times i have to say it, how many times i have to type it prove it or anything just know that i always will love you Jamila. I know that day on 1/28/25 when you told me to just "stop asking rn" is when you were in alot of stress.  
         <br>
         <br>
        I wont lie.
         <br> 
         <br>
        It did hurt hearing you say that but i figured you were in alot of stress so i passed it by.. but everyday when you say your ok we both know its a lie... you lie to help me which for one thing i have to say dont ever do that because it does more harm then help.
         <br>
         <br> 
        Just talk to me. Thats what im going for and aiming at for you to be comfortable to just talk to me..
         <br>
         <br>
        Please talk.
         <br>
        Even under pressure just let it out onto me 
         <br>
        i will let you punch me slap me or anything to let that anger go or sadness.
         <br>
         <br>
        
        To the main part below.
